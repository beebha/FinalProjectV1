CSCI-56 Final Project - Surveys Galore
========================================

About
------

This application allows a user to create surveys and publish them for other users to take.
Upon a successful login, the landing page lists all completed, incomplete and published surveys created by the logged in user.
This page is also accessed via the My Surveys tab in the footer.

Complete surveys can either have more questions added and saved or be published.
Incomplete surveys can have more questions added and then can be completed.
Published surveys are available to all users of the application.
In addition, published surveys which do not have any survey results associated, can be deactivated to be edited.

The surveys fall within the following categories:

    - Customer
    - Education
    - Entertainment
    - Employment
    - Marketing
    - Medical
    - Technology
    - Other

The All Surveys tab has a list of all published surveys of all users that a logged in user can take.

The Results tab has the results of surveys, which were created and published by the logged in user, taken by all other users.
Upon viewing each individual survey results, one can export the results in the following formats:

    - CSV
    - XLS
    - PDF
    - RTF
    - XML

A user can logout of the application at anytime by clicking the Logout button present in the header bar at the top right corner.
Based on the current page, a user may be prompted about logging out without saving any changes.

During the startup of the application, a sample user and sample surveys (complete, incomplete & published) are created for testing.
